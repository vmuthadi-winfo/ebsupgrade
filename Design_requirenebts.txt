Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Upgrade – AI Input Document
Scope: Upgrade from EBS 12.1.3 + Database 12c (Linux, SSO via Ping/SSOGEN, customizations, integrations, LB) to EBS 12.2.15 + Database 19c / 23ai.
Purpose of this document: This document is designed to be direct input to an AI system (LLM / rules engine) to:

Analyze an existing EBS environment
Identify technical, functional, and integration impacts
Quantify complexity and effort in a defensible, repeatable way
Generate a comprehensive Upgrade Impact Assessment Report
The content is intentionally explicit, structured, and non-ambiguous so an AI can reason deterministically.


1. Upgrade Context & Assumptions
1.1 Source Environment (Typical)

Oracle EBS Release: 12.1.3
Database: Oracle Database 12c
OS: Linux (OEL/RHEL – version to be detected)
Authentication: SSO integrated with PingFederate via SSOGEN
Architecture:Load Balancer (F5 / NGINX / OCI LB / Apache)
SSL termination (LB or OHS)
Possible DMZ nodes
Customizations:OAF extensions
Oracle Forms / Reports
Custom PL/SQL (CEMLI/RICEW)
BI Publisher
APEX integrations
Integrations:DB Links
File-based interfaces
SOA / REST / schedulers
1.2 Target Environment

Oracle EBS Release: 12.2.15
Database: 19c (mandatory) → 23ai (optional/future-ready)
Architecture requirements:Dual application file system (fs1 / fs2)
Non-editioned file system (fs_ne)
Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR)
Online patching using ADOP
Middleware:WebLogic Server + Oracle HTTP Server (OHS)
Authentication:Re-implemented SSO (Ping / OAM / IDCS / SSOGEN – OSSO not supported)


2. Core Architectural Changes (Non-Negotiable)
The AI must treat these as structural changes, not optional enhancements.
2.1 Application Tier

Single APPL_TOP (12.1) → Dual File System (12.2)
OC4J → WebLogic Server
Manual patching → Online patching (ADOP lifecycle)
2.2 Database Tier

No EBR → Edition-Based Redefinition required
Custom schemas must be edition-enabled
DB upgrade path:12c → 19c (mandatory)
19c → 23ai (optional, but requires CDB/PDB)
2.3 Security / SSO

Legacy OSSO/mod_osso not supported
SSO must be re-implemented
Session coordination between EBS, WebLogic, OHS, and IdP required


3. Complexity & Effort Estimation Model (AI Scoring Engine)
3.1 Design Principle
Effort is derived from environment characteristics, not guessed timelines.
The AI must compute effort using measurable complexity drivers, each scored 0–5.


3.2 Complexity Drivers (Scorable Inputs)
CD-1: Infrastructure & Topology Change
Score based on detected changes:

0: Same servers, single node, no LB/SSL changes
3: OS upgrade, minor topology change
5: New HA (RAC/Data Guard), new LB, DR build, cloud migration
Evidence sources:

OS version
Node count
LB configuration
DR presence


CD-2: Database Upgrade Complexity

0: DB already 19c certified, aligned with EBS 12.2
3: 12c → 19c, minimal custom objects
5: 12c → 19c + multitenant conversion + performance risk + integration refactoring
Evidence sources:

DB version
CDB/PDB status
Usage of deprecated features (e.g., UTL_FILE_DIR)
Custom schemas


CD-3: Online Patching & EBR Readiness

0: Minimal custom schemas, no EBR violations
3: Few violations, manageable remediation
5: Many violations, unregistered schemas, hard dependencies on EBS code
Evidence sources:

Online Patching Readiness Report
ADZDPSUM / ADZDPMAN outputs
GSCC report


CD-4: Customization Footprint (CEMLI/RICEW)

0: Very few custom objects
3: Moderate customizations, mostly isolated
5: Heavy customizations across Forms, OAF, PL/SQL, BI, APEX
Evidence sources:

Custom schemas
Custom TOPs (XX*)
Object counts by type


CD-5: Integrations Complexity

0: Few outbound/inbound interfaces
3: Several DB links, file-based jobs
5: SOA, APEX, REST, schedulers, many DB links
Evidence sources:

DB links inventory
Scheduler jobs
External endpoints


CD-6: Security & SSO Re-implementation

0: Local authentication only
3: Simple SSO without MFA
5: PingFederate + MFA + LB/SSL/session tuning
Evidence sources:

Current auth configuration
IdP type
SSL termination points


CD-7: Functional & Testing Blast Radius

0: Few modules, low usage
3: Core modules, moderate users
5: Many modules, high concurrency, business-critical flows
Evidence sources:

Enabled modules
User counts
Concurrent usage


3.3 Complexity Normalization
Total Complexity Score = Sum(CD-1 … CD-7)
Map to size:

0–8 → Small
9–16 → Medium
17–24 → Large
25+ → Very Large
This size drives relative effort, not calendar duration.


4. Workstream-Based Effort Model (No Calendar Guessing)
Effort must be distributed across standard upgrade workstreams.
4.1 Mandatory Workstreams

Infrastructure & Platform Readiness
Database Upgrade & Remediation
EBS Technical Upgrade (12.2 architecture)
Customization Remediation (EBR + Online Patching)
Security & SSO Re-implementation
Integrations Validation & Fixes
Testing (SIT, UAT, Performance)
Cutover & Hypercare
Each workstream effort is weighted by relevant complexity drivers.


5. Automated Data Collection (AI Tool Inputs)
5.1 Application Tier Collector

EBS release and patch levels (AD, TXK, ATG)
Context file inventory
File system layout (fs1/fs2/fs_ne)
adop configuration
Custom TOPs and code inventory
5.2 Database Collector

DB version and patch level
CDB/PDB status
Custom schemas
Invalid objects
DB links
Directory objects
5.3 Integrations Collector

DB links + hostnames
Scheduler jobs
File drop locations
SOA/APEX endpoints
5.4 Security / SSO Collector

Authentication method
IdP details
SSL certificates
Session timeout configuration


6. Oracle Analyzer Outputs (Mandatory Inputs)
The AI must ingest raw outputs, not summaries:

Online Patching Readiness Report
ETCC (DB + MT)
EBS Upgrade Analyzer (RUP option)
DB Upgrade Analyzer (19c / 23ai)
These define Oracle-supported boundaries and blockers.


7. Rules Engine (Deterministic Findings)
Before LLM summarization, apply explicit rules:
Examples:

If unregistered custom schemas exist → Blocker
If DB is < 19c → Mandatory DB upgrade
If DB links reference invalid hosts → Integration risk
If APEX schema not edition-enabled → Online patching incompatibility
Rules must produce:

Blockers
Risks
Required remediation actions


8. AI-Generated Outputs (Final Report Sections)
The AI must generate:

Executive Summary
Current vs Target Compatibility Matrix
Impact Analysis by Layer (Infra, DB, App, Security, Integrations)
Customization Remediation Plan
Complexity & Effort Summary (by workstream)
Risk Register
Recommended Upgrade Approach Options


9. Design Philosophy

Treat EBS 12.2 upgrade as platform transformation, not a patch
Online patching & EBR are first-class constraints
Effort estimation must be evidence-based and repeatable
AI augments analysis; rules and Oracle analyzers define truth
